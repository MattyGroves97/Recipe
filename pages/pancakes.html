        <h1>One Cup Pancakes </h1>    
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Delicious pancakes made with only one cup of each ingredient.</p>
        
                
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul><strong>ONE</strong> cup of flour</ul>
        <ul><strong>ONE</strong> cup of milk</ul>
        <ul><strong>ONE</strong> large egg</ul>
        <ul>A pinch of sea salt</ul>
        
        <h4><em>Optional...</em></h4>
        <ul>Four scoops of greek yoghurt</ul>
        <ul>A handfull of blueberres</ul>
        <ul>Olive oil</ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>To make the batter, crack the egg into a large mixing bowl.  </ol>
        <ol>Add the flour, milk and a tiny pinch of sea salt.</ol>
        <ol>Whisk everything together until you have a lovely, smooth batter.</ol>
        <ol>Fold through the blueberries, if using.  </ol>
        <ol>Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and after a minute or so, add ½ tablespoon of oil.</ol>
        <ol>Carefully tilt the pan to spread the oil out evenly.</ol>
        <ol>Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly – each ladleful will make one pancake, and you’ll need to cook them in batches.</ol>
        <ol>Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then use a fish slice to carefully flip them over.</ol>
        <ol>    When the pancakes are golden on both sides, use a fish slice to transfer the pancakes to a plate.</ol>
        <ol> Repeat steps 5 to 9 with the remaining batter, adding ½ tablespoon of oil to the pan between batches, if needed. </ol>
        <ol>Serve the pancakes straight away, topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt, and some extra berries, if you like.</ol>

        <h4><em>Tips</em></h4>
        <p>These are the easiest pancakes to make – you don’t even need scales to weigh your ingredients. All you need is a cup or a mug. As long as you use the same cup for measuring both the flour and the milk, you’ll be laughing </p>
