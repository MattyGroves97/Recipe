        <h1>One Cup Pancakes </h1>    
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Delicious pancakes made with only one cup of each ingredient.</p>
        
                
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>


        <ul>
        <li><strong>ONE</strong> cup of flour</li>
            <li><strong>ONE</strong> cup of milk</li>
                <li><strong>ONE</strong> large egg</li>
                    <li>A pinch of sea salt</li>
                    </ul>
        
        <h4><em>Optional...</em></h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Four scoops of greek yoghurt</li>
        <li>A handfull of blueberres</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>To make the batter, crack the egg into a large mixing bowl. </li> 
        <li>Add the flour, milk and a tiny pinch of sea salt.</li>
            <li>Whisk everything together until you have a lovely, smooth batter.</li>
                <li>Fold through the blueberries, if using. </li>
                    <li>Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and after a minute or so, add ½ tablespoon of oil.</li>
                        <li>Carefully tilt the pan to spread the oil out evenly.</li>
                            <li>Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly – each ladleful will make one pancake, and you’ll need to cook them in batches.</li>
                                <li>Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then use a fish slice to carefully flip them over.</li>
                                    <li>    When the pancakes are golden on both sides, use a fish slice to transfer the pancakes to a plate.</li>
                                        <li> Repeat steps 5 to 9 with the remaining batter, adding ½ tablespoon of oil to the pan between batches, if needed. </li>
                                            <li>Serve the pancakes straight away, topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt, and some extra berries, if you like.</li>
         </ol>

        <h4><em>Tips</em></h4>
        <p>These are the easiest pancakes to make – you don’t even need scales to weigh your ingredients. All you need is a cup or a mug. As long as you use the same cup for measuring both the flour and the milk, you’ll be laughing </p>
